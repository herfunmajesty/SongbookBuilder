[Dm] [C] Take me [Dm] out [C]
To[Bb]night [Bb] [F] [C]
Where there's [Dm] music and there's [C] people

[Bb] [Bb] [F] [C]

[Dm] Driving [C] in your [Dm] car [C]
I [Bb] never never want to go [F] home

And in the [Dm] darkened [C] under [Dm] pass I thought [C]
Oh [Bb] God, my chance has [Bb] come at last! [F] [C]
But then a [Dm] strange fear [C] gripped me and I [Dm] just couldn't [C] ask
[Bb] [Bb] [F] [C]

[Dm] [C] Take me [Dm] out [C]
To[Bb]night [Bb] [F] [C] oh take me
