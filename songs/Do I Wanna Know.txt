<i>Intro </i>
[Am] ...   [F//][Dm//]
[Dm] ...   [Am] ...  

<i>(Verse)</i>

[Am] Have you got colour in your [F//] cheeks? [Dm//] ...
[Dm] Do you ever get that fear that you can't [Am] shift the tide
That sticks around like [Am] summat in your teeth?
Are there some [F//] aces up your sle[Dm//]eve?
[Dm] Have you no idea that you're in [Am] deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly [Am] every night this week
How many [F//] secrets can you [Dm//] keep?
[Dm] 'Cause there's this tune I found
That [Am] makes me think of you somehow 
And I [Am] play it on repeat
[F//] Until I  [Dm//]  fall asleep, [Dm]spillin' drinks on my [E7] settee

<i>(Pre-chorus)</i>
(Do I [F] wanna know?) If this [Dm] feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to [Am] see you go) Was sorta [Am] hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, [F] we both know) That the [Dm] nights were mainly made
For sayin' [Am] things that you can't say tomorrow [Am] day

<i>(Chorus)</i>
Crawlin' back to [Am] you
Ever thought of [F//] callin' [Dm//]  when
[Dm] You've had a few?
'Cause I always [Am] do
Maybe I'm [Am] too
Busy bein' [F//] yours
To [Dm//] fall for somebody new
[Dm] Now, I've thought it  [Am] through
Crawlin' back to [Am] you

<i>(Verse)</i>
So have you got the [F//] guts? [Dm//] ...
[Dm] Been wonderin' if your heart's still [Am] open
And if so, I wanna [Am] know what time it shuts
[F//] Simmer down an' [Dm//] pucker up, [Dm]  I'm sorry to interrupt
It's [Am] just I'm constantly on the cusp [Am] of try-yin' to [F//] kiss you [Dm//] ...
[Dm] But I don't know if you feel the [Am] same as I do
[Am] … But we could be [F//] together [Dm//] ... [Dm] … if you wanted [E7] to

<i>(Pre-chorus)</i>
(Do I [F] wanna know?) If this [Dm] feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to [Am] see you go) Was sorta [Am] hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, [F] we both know) That the [Dm] nights were mainly made
For sayin' [Am] things that you can't say tomorrow [Am] day

<i>(Chorus)</i>
Crawlin' back to [Am] you
Ever thought of [F//] callin' [Dm//]  when
[Dm] You've had a few?
'Cause I always [Am] do
Maybe I'm [Am] too
Busy bein' [F//] yours
To [Dm//]  fall for somebody new
[Dm] Now, I've thought it [Am] through
Crawlin' back to [Am] you

<i>(Outro)</i>
(Do I [F] wanna know?) If this [Dm] feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to [Am] see you go) Was sorta [Am] hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, [F] we both know) That the [Dm] nights were mainly made
For sayin' [Am] things that you can't say tomorrow [Am] day
(Do I [F] wanna know?) Too busy bein' [Dm] yours to fall
(Sad to [Am] see you go) Ever thought of [G] callin', darlin'?
(Do I [F]wanna know?) Do you want me [Dm] crawlin' back to [Am] you?
[Am/]
